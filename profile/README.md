Our vision is to set a new global standard for AI in public administration. We empower city councils and local governments with intelligent, open-source tools that streamline operations, reduce bureaucracy, and enhance public service delivery.

## 🚀 What We're Building

Our flagship project is **Iapacte**, an AI-driven OS for municipalities. The first application is a powerful **AI Tender Writer** designed to revolutionize public procurement in Spain.

### Key Features:
- **🧠 Intelligent Document Generation:** Create compliant tender documents in minutes.
- **📊 Data-Driven Insights:** Analyze market prices and best practices from thousands of public tenders.
- **✅ Legal Compliance:** Ensure all generated documents meet Spanish public procurement law.
